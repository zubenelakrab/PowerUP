## 🪝 Interactive Development Hooks

Mario PowerUps includes a comprehensive hook system that integrates with modern AI development environments.

### Hook System Overview

The hook system uses **standard JSON stdin format** with intelligent exit code handling:

- **Exit Code 0**: Success - output shown in transcript mode (Ctrl-R)
- **Exit Code 1**: Non-blocking warning - shown to user  
- **Exit Code 2**: Blocking error - prevents tool execution, shown to AI system

### Active Hooks

#### 🪙 Coin Collection System (PostToolUse)
**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/coin-collector.sh`  
**Triggers**: After every successful tool use  
**Features**:
- Persistent coin tracking across sessions
- Success streak detection with Star Power mode
- World progression through 8 coding worlds (1-1 to 8-1)
- Milestone celebrations at 10, 50, 100+ achievements

**JSON Input Format**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_response": {"success": true},
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "cwd": "/current/working/directory"
}
```

**Example Output**:
```
🪙 *ding* Coin collected! (47 total) Great Write usage!
⭐ STAR POWER ACTIVATED! 10 consecutive successes!
🏰 Bowser's Castle! You've reached the final challenge!
```

#### 🛡️ Mario Safety Guardian (PreToolUse)
**File**: `~/.claude/hooks/mario-safety-guardian.sh`  
**Triggers**: Before bash command execution  
**Features**:
- Dangerous command detection and blocking
- Character-based warnings with Mario personality
- Best practice encouragement for file operations

**JSON Input Format**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {"command": "rm -rf /"},
  "session_id": "abc123"
}
```

**Example Outputs**:
```bash
# Dangerous command detected (Exit Code 2 - Blocks execution)
⚠️  🍄 MARIO SAYS: 'Mamma mia! That looks VERY dangerous!'
🎮 Remember: With great power comes great responsibility!
🛡️  Double-check your command before proceeding, hero!

# Encouraging message (Exit Code 0 - Proceeds normally)
✨ Princess Peach suggests: 'Remember to test your elegant changes!'
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Customize installation directory
MARIO_POWERUPS_DIR="$HOME/.claude"

# Optional: Enable debug mode for hooks
MARIO_DEBUG=true

# Optional: Customize coin milestone thresholds
MARIO_COIN_MILESTONES="10,25,50,100,250,500,1000"

### Custom Hook Development

Create your own Mario-themed hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.claude/hooks/custom-mario-hook.sh

# Read JSON input from stdin
INPUT=$(cat)

# Parse with Python for reliability
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
try:
    data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    print(data.get('tool_name', ''))
except:
    print('')
" 2>/dev/null)

# Your custom Mario logic here
if [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "YourTargetTool" ]; then
    echo "🍄 Your custom Mario message!"
fi

exit 0
```

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "YourTargetTool",
        "hooks": [
