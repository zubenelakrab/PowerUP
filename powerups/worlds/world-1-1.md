let heroName = "Your Name Here";     // String - like a name tag
let coinCount = 0;                   // Number - count of treasures
let isLearning = true;              // Boolean - yes/no answers
let skillsLearned = [];             // Array - collection of abilities

// Let's see what we've stored!
console.log(`🎮 Hero: ${heroName}`);
console.log(`🪙 Coins Collected: ${coinCount}`);

## 🐢 World 1-1 Learning Challenges (Friendly Obstacles)

### 🦶 **Goombas** - Syntax Errors (Your First Friendly Challenges)
*These aren't scary enemies - they're learning opportunities that make you stronger!*

**Common Goomba Friends to Learn From**:
```javascript
// 🦶 The Missing Semicolon Goomba (teaches attention to detail)
console.log("Hello World")  // 🤔 "Hmm, something's missing here!"
console.log("Hello World"); // ✅ "Wahoo! Perfect syntax!"
// 🎊 Lesson learned: Semicolons help JavaScript understand where statements end!

// 🦶 The Spelling Challenge Goomba (teaches careful naming)
console.log(myVariabel);     // 🤔 "Close, but not quite right!"
console.log(myVariable);     // ✅ "Excellent spelling!"
// 🎊 Lesson learned: Exact spelling matters in programming!

// 🦶 The Bracket Balance Goomba (teaches code structure)
if (true) {                  // 🤔 "We started something, but didn't finish it!"
    console.log("Hello");
// Missing closing bracket - every opening needs a closing!

if (true) {                  // ✅ "Perfect balance!"
    console.log("Hello");
}  // 🎊 Lesson learned: Every { needs a matching }!
```

### 🐢 **Koopa Troopas** - Logic Challenges (Thinking Puzzles)
*These require a bit more thinking - perfect for building problem-solving skills!*

```javascript
// 🐢 The Counting Challenge Koopa (teaches array indexing)
// "Hmm, this looks right, but the results are unexpected..."
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {  // 🤔 "This starts at 1, but arrays start at 0!"
    console.log(`Item ${i}`);
}
// 🎊 Learning moment: Arrays start counting at 0, not 1!

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {   // ✅ "Now we're thinking like programmers!"
    console.log(`Item ${i}`);
}
// 🏆 Lesson learned: Understanding how computers count is a superpower!

// 🐢 The Logic Puzzle Koopa (teaches conditional thinking)
let score = 85;
if (score > 90) {               // 🤔 "Why isn't this working for score 85?"
    console.log("Great job!");
}
// 🎊 Learning moment: We need to think about all possible cases!

if (score >= 80) {              // ✅ "Now we're covering more cases!"
    console.log("Good work!");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    console.log("Keep trying!");
} else {
    console.log("Let's practice more!");
}
// 🏆 Lesson learned: Good logic covers all the possibilities!
```
