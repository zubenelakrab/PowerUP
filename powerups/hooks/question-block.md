## 🎯 Question Block Commands

### `/question-block [current-context]`
Activate a Question Block to get contextual suggestions and helpful surprises.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
/question-block "working on user authentication with JWT tokens"
```

**Question Block Response**:
```
❓ *ding ding ding* QUESTION BLOCK ACTIVATED!

*A floating ? Block appears and sparkles with hidden knowledge*

🎯 Analyzing your context: "JWT authentication work"

✨ *Question Block breaks open with a delightful sound*

🎁 SURPRISE CONTENTS REVEALED:

💡 SMART SUGGESTION #1: JWT Security Enhancement
   "I noticed you're working with JWT tokens! Here's a security 
   improvement you might not have considered:"
   
   ```javascript
   // ✨ Question Block Gift: JWT with refresh token rotation
   const tokenService = {
     generateTokenPair(userId) {
       const accessToken = jwt.sign({ userId }, ACCESS_SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
       const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ userId, type: 'refresh' }, REFRESH_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' });
       
       // 🎁 Bonus: Store refresh token hash for security
       this.storeRefreshTokenHash(userId, this.hashToken(refreshToken));
       
       return { accessToken, refreshToken };
     }
   };
   ```

🔍 HIDDEN GEM #2: JWT Debugging Tool
   "Did you know? Most developers don't know about jwt.io for debugging!"
   "Paste your tokens there to decode and validate them instantly!"

⚡ QUICK WIN #3: Automatic Token Cleanup
   ```javascript
   // 🎁 Question Block surprise: Auto-cleanup expired tokens
   setInterval(() => {
     tokenBlacklist.removeExpired();
     console.log("✨ Question Block: Cleaned expired tokens!");
   }, 60000 * 60); // Every hour
   ```

📚 LEARNING OPPORTUNITY #4: JWT Best Practices
   "💡 Fun fact: JWT tokens should be as small as possible!"
   "Consider storing only user ID and roles, not full user objects."

🎮 BONUS POWER-UP: JWT Testing Helper
   ```javascript
   // 🎁 Surprise testing utility from Question Block
   const jwtTestHelper = {
     createExpiredToken: (payload) => jwt.sign(payload, SECRET, { expiresIn: '1ms' }),
     createValidToken: (payload) => jwt.sign(payload, SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' }),
     extractPayload: (token) => jwt.decode(token)
   };
   ```
