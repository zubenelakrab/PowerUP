      3. **Talent Risk**: Top engineers are leaving due to frustration with legacy systems

      - Reduce system maintenance overhead by 60%
      - Enable support for 10x user growth

## 🎭 Character Signature

*"The transition from individual contributor to technical leader is not just about learning new skills - it's about fundamentally changing how you create value. As an IC, you succeed by writing great code. As a leader, you succeed by enabling others to write great code, by making strategic decisions that multiply your impact across entire organizations, and by building systems and cultures that outlast your individual contributions. Rule your technical domain not through force, but through wisdom, vision, and the development of others who will build even greater kingdoms than your own!"*

**King K. Rool's Leadership Motto**: *"Great leaders don't just build great software - they build great leaders who build great software!"*
