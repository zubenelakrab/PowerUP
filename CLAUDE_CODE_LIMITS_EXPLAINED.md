# 🪙📊 Claude Code Usage Limits - What Mario's Token Counter Really Tracks 📊🪙

Based on your detailed explanation of Claude's real limits, here's exactly what our Mario Token Counter system now tracks and why it's revolutionary:

## 🎯 **Real Claude Code Limits (What Actually Matters)**

### 📅 **5-Hour Session Windows** (Primary Limits)
- **Pro Plan**: ~10-40 prompts every 5 hours (varies by prompt complexity)
- **Max Plan (5x)**: ~50-200 prompts every 5 hours
- **Max Plan (20x)**: ~200-800 prompts every 5 hours

### 📅 **Weekly Limits** (New Aug 2025 - Affects ~5% Power Users)
- **Rolling 7-day window** that resets every week
- **Targets power users** who run Claude Code intensively
- **Max users can purchase** additional usage when needed

## 🧠 **Why Our System is Revolutionary**

### ❌ **What Most People Think Claude Tracks:**
- "Just count tokens and estimate usage"
- "5 hours = unlimited until you hit some mysterious wall"
- "Token counting is accurate enough"

### ✅ **What Claude ACTUALLY Tracks (And We Now Do Too):**
- **Request-based limits** (prompts matter more than raw tokens)
- **Plan-specific multipliers** (Pro vs Max 5x vs Max 20x)
- **Dual window tracking** (5-hour sessions + weekly caps)
- **Usage pattern analysis** (intensive vs normal development)

## 🔥 **Mario Token Counter's Smart Features**

## 🚀 **Practical Benefits for Developers**

### 🎯 **Multi-Plan Optimization**
1. **Compare Plans Instantly**: See how your usage fits across Pro, Max 5x, and Max 20x
2. **Smart Upgrade Decisions**: Know exactly when upgrading makes sense
3. **Cost Optimization**: Don't over-pay for capacity you don't need
4. **Plan Complex Sessions**: Understand your limits before starting intensive work
5. **Usage Patterns**: Track efficiency across different plan tiers

### 📈 **Smart Plan-Specific Recommendations**
```bash
💡 Plan-Specific Guidance:
  🚨 Pro: LIMIT REACHED! Consider upgrading to Max for more capacity
  🟡 Max 5x: High usage - consider Max 20x for heavy workflows  
  👑 Max 20x: Unlimited-like capacity for enterprise workflows

🚨 WEEKLY LIMIT WARNING: Approaching Aug 2025 weekly caps!
👑 Max users can purchase additional usage if needed
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### 📊 **Smart Reset Detection**
- **5-Hour Tracking**: Automatically resets when Claude's session window refreshes
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Tracks rolling 7-day usage for new Aug 2025 limits
- **Reset Type Awareness**: Different messages for session vs weekly resets

### 🧠 **Plan-Aware Analytics**
- **Auto-Detection**: Attempts to identify Pro vs Max usage patterns
- **Limit Recommendations**: Suggests plan upgrades when approaching limits
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Tokens per prompt (more relevant than raw token counts)

### 💾 **Persistent Session Tracking**
```json
{
  "claude_code_metadata": {
    "last_5h_reset": "2025-01-10T14:30:52Z",
    "last_weekly_reset": "2025-01-10T14:30:52Z", 
    "estimated_plan": "pro",
    "reset_type": "session_reset"
  }
}
```

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**

### 📊 **Before Mario Token Counter:**
- ❌ "I don't know how much Claude Code I've used"
- ❌ "Suddenly hit limits without warning"
- ❌ "Can't optimize my development workflow"
- ❌ "Don't understand the new weekly limits"

### ✅ **With Mario Multi-Plan Token Counter:**
- ✅ **Multi-plan comparison** showing Pro, Max 5x, and Max 20x usage simultaneously
- ✅ **Smart upgrade recommendations** based on actual usage patterns
- ✅ **Cost optimization insights** - know if you're over/under-paying for capacity
- ✅ **Plan-specific warnings** with targeted guidance for each tier
- ✅ **Visual progress tracking** with color-coded bars for each plan
- ✅ **Weekly limit monitoring** for new Aug 2025 rules

## 🎊 **The Result**

Mario's Token Counter transforms Claude Code from a **"black box"** usage experience into a **transparent, optimized, and predictable** development workflow.

You'll never be surprised by limits again, and you'll use Claude Code more efficiently than 95% of users who don't understand the real limit system!
