   - 🧹 `progress-saver.sh` - PreCompact/Stop hooks for progress persistence
   - 🎵 `sound-effects.sh` - Audio feedback integration where supported

3. **⚙️ Advanced Configuration Templates** - Provide pre-configured settings for:
   - 🎯 Development workflow optimization (different hooks for different project types)
   - 🛡️ Security-first configurations for sensitive projects
   - 🚀 Performance-focused setups for large codebases
   - 🎮 Full gaming experience with all Mario mechanics enabled

### 🎮 **Hook Integration Strategy**

Each hook will embody Mario character personalities and leverage the full power of Claude Code's hook system:

- **📊 Data-Driven**: All hooks will use proper JSON input/output schemas
- **🎭 Character-Authentic**: Each hook maintains Mario character personality 
- **🚀 Performance-Optimized**: Minimal overhead with intelligent caching
- **🔒 Security-First**: Advanced validation and sanitization patterns
- **🌍 World-Progressive**: Integration with 8-world mastery progression system
- **🎮 Gaming-Complete**: Full RPG-style mechanics (coins, achievements, streaks, power-ups)

This represents the evolution from simple notification hooks to a comprehensive, interactive development experience that gamifies the entire coding workflow while maintaining professional functionality and security standards.

**The result**: A living, breathing Mario universe that accompanies developers on their coding journey, celebrating victories, preventing mistakes, and providing contextual guidance based on their skill level and progress through the legendary worlds of software mastery! 🍄⭐
